//There are a total of n tasks you have to pick, labeled from 0 to n-1. 
//Some tasks may have prerequisites tasks, for example to pick task 0 you have to first finish tasks 1, 
//which is expressed as a pair: [0, 1]
//Input:
//n = 2, m = 1
//prerequisites = {{1, 0}}
//Output:
//1
//Explanation:
//The output 1 denotes that the order is valid. So, if you have, implemented your function correctly, then output
//would be 1 for all test cases. One possible order is [0, 1].
